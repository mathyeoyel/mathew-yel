    "excerpt": "In 2022, I created Yelose Graphics without a big plan in mind. At first, it was just a Google Business profile I set up for fun. What I didn’t realize was that this small step would change the course of my creative journey — and eventually take me all the way to the Digitally Fit Awards stage in East Africa.",
    "content": "From a Fun Idea to a Growing Brand\nYelose Graphics started with curiosity. I wanted a space to share my design work and connect with people. Slowly, it turned into something bigger — clients reached out, projects grew, and Yelose Graphics became more than a hobby.\n\nIn South Sudan, the creative industry is still young. Many talented people have skills but lack platforms to showcase them. This inspired me to push forward, not just for myself, but for others who believe in creativity.\n\nLessons Along the Way\nAs Yelose Graphics grew, I learned three things that shaped my path:\n\nConsistency builds trust: Even when recognition feels far away, showing up matters.\nCommunity makes the journey richer: My involvement with the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) at the University of Juba showed me firsthand how powerful collaboration and shared knowledge can be. It wasn’t just about coding or design, it was about learning to grow together as young innovators.\nVisibility creates opportunity. That one Google profile brought me clients I never expected.\nStanding on the Awards Stage\nIn 2024, I received the Digitally Fit Award – Top Graphic Designer (Gold Category) during the East Africa Edition. That recognition was a turning point.\n\nA year later, in 2025, I traveled to Nairobi for the Person of the Year - Kenya Edition. There, I was again recognized, this time with the Top Graphic Designer (Bronze Category) award.\n\nStanding on that stage reminded me of how far a small idea could grow when fueled by persistence and passion.\n\nWhat Comes Next\nWinning awards is not the destination. For me, it’s a call to do more. Through Yelose Graphics and my new platform, VikraHub, I’m committed to:\n\nCreating opportunities for South Sudanese creatives.\nBuilding digital platforms where talent can thrive.\nInspiring the next generation to dream beyond limitations.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhen I look back, I see a journey that started with “just for fun” and turned into something bigger than I imagined. If you’re a creative reading this, here’s my advice: start now, with what you have. Your small steps today could lead to your biggest achievements tomorrow.\n\nAlong this journey, I’m also proud to be a member of the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) at the University of Juba, where I continue to learn, share, and connect with other young innovators across the globe.\n\nWritten by\nMathew Yel (Yelose)\n\nAward-Winning Creative Designer, GDSC Member (University of Juba), and Founder of Yelose Graphics & VikraHub.\n\nPassionate about design, technology, and empowering African creatives to dream beyond limitations.",
